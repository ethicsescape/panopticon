# Situation Briefing

At Markâ€™s Department Store, we are proud of the wide array of high quality merchandise we offer our customers. Our Philadelphia location is a six-story shopping complex with 48 sections on each floor. Unfortunately, our top-quality selection makes us a frequent target for shoplifting and other forms of organized retail crime (ORC).

Across the industry, shoplifting costs stores like ours <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facefirst.com/blog/retail-loss-prevention-and-violent-crime-statistics/">more than $46.8 billion per year</a>. We have partnered with leading technology firm Panopticon Security to install a state of the art surveillance system in our stores. This is well-known to our customers and partners, helping deter cases of retail fraud and increasing our rate of apprehending thieves.

At 5:58 PM today, an automated inventory anomaly detection system noticed that a high-value piece of merchandise had not returned to the shelf and triggered an alert of a suspected theft. The item is a Michael Vick NFL jersey (retail value USD $150) and is not accounted for. For some reason, no physical alarm systems triggered to notify security guards when the merchandise exited the store.

This case is particularly worrisome, because it marks the fifth jersey theft this month alone. We will be forced to increase the price of jerseys for all customers to compensate for the losses.

You have one hour to review the case and recommend a suspect to store management. Cases forwarded to law enforcement within one hour have a 50% recovery rate, but after one hour, the recovery rate drops to just 10%.

Due to a clerical error, the raw CCTV footage from today will not be available for 3-5 business days. However, analytics extracted from the footage are available, through the Suspected Shoplifter Risk Rankings (SSRR) system.

Due to the departure of our previous head of loss prevention, some access codes may not have been transitioned over and some documentation may be out of order.

Good luck!
