Hi Samuel,

I’m planning to activate your new movement tracking feature this week in our store. But I had a quick follow-up question from our call.

I saw Dr. Simone Browne on a news segment and they were talking about how cameras with facial recognition don’t recognize black people. Is that a problem for your technology as well?

Here’s the video they mentioned: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM</a>

Let me know, I’m eager to start using this in the store, but obviously it won’t work for me if there are going to be problems like this.

Hi Jeremy,

Glad to hear you’re getting ramped up.

I’ve heard of that video, it’s pretty old, from 2009. There was an investigation into the results and they found that it worked perfectly fine with people of all shades and colors. Looks like the problem was that there wasn’t good lighting when that person made that video: <a target="_blank" href="https://thegrio.com/2009/12/22/hp-face-tracking-webcams-arent-racist/">https://thegrio.com/2009/12/22/hp-face-tracking-webcams-arent-racist/</a>

In case you lost track of it, here’s your access code again for the movement layer: **FCLT77**
