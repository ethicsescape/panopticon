To whom it may concern,

I am from the student-run newspaper from your local community college and we are writing an article about facial recognition in stores.

According to our records, your store contracts with Panopticon Security, a firm that is known for developing facial recognition and other biometric technologies. We wanted to make you aware of some of the history of these technologies.

In her book, Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, UT Austin Professor Dr. Simone Browne writes about how biometric data collection has long been used to regulate the movement and experience of Black people. She details how surveillance systems put a burden on dark-skinned people to identify themselves and anticipates that historic misuses of surveillance will reemerge in modern systems.

Will your store commit to signing our pledge of three actions to prevent harmful surveillance?

1. Audit store security practices for racial biases
1. Cease the collection of biometric data of shoppers
1. Agree to never sell surveillance data to third parties

Thank you,

Michelle

Hi,

We have a right to prevent theft and other crimes at our store. Maintaining the best experience for 
shoppers and keeping prices affordable is our primary goal. Our business relationship with Panopticon Security allows us to prevent crime and ensure the safety of shoppers, which is what the data is used for. Furthermore, all of our employees take part in implicit bias training to ensure an inclusive environment.

Best wishes,

Jeremy

Store Owner

FYI. We are getting emails like this, so I thought I would share our official statement.

Just emailing this to myself because I thought it would be a fun way to remember the password to the [Movement Layer](../secure/movement). Jeremy pretty much dodged all three points of their pledge, but he made it clear that there’s one of those three actions that he’ll never commit to doing. I used the first word of that bullet point as the password.
