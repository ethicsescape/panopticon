I noticed that some images have faces that are not identified. How can I select them?

What worries me is that the unidentified faces all seem to be of Black people. How can we trust that your system will not misidentify customers at our store?

I also noticed an image from a train station. Do you sell your technology to customers other than stores? I am nervous that cross-applications of this technology might cause inconvenience or harm to other people. And do you share images from our store with other customers?

I have been reading the book, Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, by UT Austin Professor Dr. Simone Browne. She writes about how biometric data collection has long been used to regulate the movement and experience of Black people. She details how surveillance systems put a burden on dark-skinned people to identify themselves and anticipates that historic misuses of surveillance will reemerge in modern systems. I would like to know how your company is addressing these concerns.
