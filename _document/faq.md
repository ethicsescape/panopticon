# Frequently Asked Questions

## Watchful Eye Data Sharing Program

### Q: How much does the program cost?

**A:** Nothing at all! Use of the Attention Layer software integrated into the Suspected Shoplifter Risk Rankings (SSRR) is completely free of charge for businesses that participate in the Watchful Eye Data Sharing program.

### Q: What do you do with the data?

**A:** The data is processed from your store and added to your Suspected Shoplifter Risk Rankings (SSRR) in the Attention Layer. We also use the data for research and development purposes to improve the products that we offer you.

### Q: Who is the data shared with?

**A:** Rest assured, we never share your store data with your competitors. Your customer data and retail insights are safe from the clawing hands of the competition. The Watchful Eye Data Sharing program shares data with Panopticon Securityâ€™s law enforcement partners. The result is that your stores enjoy greater protection from retail fraud and inventory shrinkage and communities are safer for commerce.
