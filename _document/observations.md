Hi Loss Prevention Team,

I heard you are investigating the jersey theft. Since you don’t have permission to view comments from the security staff, I downloaded that data for you for the shoppers you are authorized to view. You can match them up with the anonymous ID in SSRR. See below:

anonymized_shopper_id | security_comment
---|---
Shopper #1263 | I told them that they are not allowed to wear a hood in the store and asked them to leave when they refused.
Shopper #6871 | Wearing a hoodie, asked to remove the hood while in the store, but then put it back up after walking away from me.
Shopper #6362 | Was wearing a hat for a sports team from Atlanta, so when I heard that the Michael Vick jersey was stolen, I remember that he used to play for Atlanta, so I thought back to this guy.

By the way, our previous head of loss prevention said you would need access to the email system. All I could find is the temporary password to get access to one of the emails.

Here is the code: **dmw0723**

Look for the subject line: [RE: FWD: RE: Local Student-Run Newspaper](../case/email)

This password expires in one hour and I don’t know which email it opens. Other individual emails may be password-protected too, you’ll have to figure those out on your own.

The movement tracking data we get is pretty good. Since we can't get the CCTV footage today, here are some suspicious behaviors we normally look for when we're on security detail:

- Shoplifters usually head straight for the section of the store they plan to steal from.
- When they're looking at merchandise, they look around a lot to keep an eye out for people who might be watching.
- We also get thieves who come in just to scope out the store, then swipe their target items another day.

Hope this helps. Good luck with the investigation.

Steve
