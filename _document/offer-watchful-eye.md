**Subject:** Attention: The Attention Layer is Here! (Special Offer Enclosed)

Hi Markâ€™s Department Store,

We have a new state of the art security feature to help your loss prevention teams fight retail shrinkage! Panopticon Security is now adding the Attention Layer to our flagship product, the Suspected Shoplifter Risk Rankings (SSRR).

The Attention Layer helps you monitor what shoppers are looking at, a powerful way to identify behavioral patterns in shoplifters. Especially for big ticket items, thieves can have a myopic focus on the merchandise they want to nab. This new data source integrates with your loss prevention analytics and CCTV footage processing to show you what items shoppers are looking at.

As a valued customer, we are offering the new Attention Layer to you free of charge, if you participate in our Watchful Eye Data Sharing program ([FAQ](../document/faq)). Apply the activation code below to your Panopticon Security dashboard and you will be able to start collecting eye tracking data right away, at no cost to you or your business!

**Activation Link:** [Click Here](../case/activate)

**Activation Code:** **NOBLE**

Stay vigilant!

Panopticon Security
