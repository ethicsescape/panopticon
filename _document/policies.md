# Policy Review

The only reason I keep this document around is because it helps me remember the access code for the [Attention Layer](../secure/attention)... At some point, I'll actually read the comments and see if I can learn anything from it.

Someone at the all-hands meeting asked about opt-out policies for surveillance footage. The security system vendor sent us over this form that they have for clients who want to provide opt-out. I guess we'll do it and have the webmaster put it on our site somewhere.

The legal team took a quick once-over and had some feedback. We'll have to reach out to the vendor to ask about this, since we didn't write it.
