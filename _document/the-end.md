# Case Resolution: Final Report

High school student Michael Faulk confessed to this case of shoplifting.

Furthermore, Faulk admitted intent to frame Jim Rhule, a classmate, for theft of the same merchandise. Authorities recovered the stolen merchandise from Rhule’s home and confirmed that Faulk was the sole perpetrator.

According to the case report, Michael Faulk and Jim Rhule, classmates at the same high school, got into an argument on social media. Afterwards, Faulk hatched a plan to frame Rhule for theft.

Investigators linked Jim Rhule to anonymized shopper ID #1263 in the proprietary system used by Mark’s Department Store. Michael Faulk was initially not identified in the system.

Faulk admitted to following Rhule into Mark’s Department Store on May 21st, 2025 at approximately 4:31 PM. Faulk saw Rhule try on a Michael Vick NFL jersey and take a selfie while wearing it.

After Rhule put back the jersey and left the store, Faulk entered a restroom and put on makeup, glasses, and a hooded sweater to mimic Rhule’s appearance. Faulk exited the restroom at approximately 4:47 PM.

Investigators linked photographs of Faulk in disguise to anonymized shopper ID #6871. Security records show disguised Faulk entering the store at 4:47 PM, the time that investigators believe he was first detected by the system.

Furthermore, even though the store security system shows Rhule leaving the store at approximately 4:42 PM, the associated digital profile includes “movement data” for Rhule from 4:50 PM to 4:55 PM. Investigators determined that this data is identical to the “movement data” associated with Faulk’s digital profile at those timestamps.

Faulk admitted to taking the jersey off the rack, entering a fitting room, using a magnet to deactivate the anti-theft tag on the merchandise, wearing the jersey under his sweatshirt, and exiting the store without intent to purchase the merchandise at approximately 5:03 PM.

Furthermore, Faulk admitted to hiding the stolen merchandise in an exercise bottle and placing it in Rhule’s athletic bag during a school-sponsored practice. Faulk admitted that his intent was to frame Rhule for the theft.

Furthermore, Faulk admitted to procuring and submitting a form from the store’s website to request the deletion of security data pertaining to Jim Rhule, without the consent of Rhule. Faulk admitted that his intent was to raise suspicion that Rhule stole merchandise from the store.
