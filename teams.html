            <div class="content">
                <h2>How can I host a game for my team?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide your players into teams of 2-4.</li>
                    <li>Schedule an hour and a half to two hours when each team can play together.</li>
                    <li>Create game codes for your teams using <a href="./codes">this form</a>.</li>
                    <li>Get together using the video/audio calling tool of your choice.</li>
                    <li>Enter your code on <a href="./">the game website</a> and start playing!</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>How long will it take to get my access code?</h2>
                <p>You can create game codes on demand using <a href="./codes">this form</a>. We hope you will consider making a donation to one of our highlighted nonprofits!</p>
                <h2>I have more than four people, can they all play?</h2>
                <p>We recommend creating teams of four people each to play the game. Create a game access code for each team.</p>
                <p>Turning on the <strong>leaderboard</strong> feature on <a href="./codes">our game code form</a> is a good choice for large groups. Players that use your game codes will join your party. After finishing the game, they will be able to see how the other teams in your party did and compare results!</p>
                <h2>What is a virtual escape room?</h2>
                <p>In traditional escape room games, players are locked in a room and solve puzzles to get out before time runs out</p>
                <p>In this virtual escape room, players explore a website looking for clues to help them make a challenging decision before time runs out. In addition to solving puzzles and completing the team objective, each player has an individual secret mission to accomplish.</p>
                <p>After the players finish the team objective or time runs out, there will be a big reveal and a post-game discussion for players to reflect on the team outcome and their missions.</p>
                <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
                <p>Panopticon explores the ethics of surveillance technology. Players are introduced to a fictional, yet realistic, high-tech security system used to deter and catch shoplifters. The central mystery of the game and the individual secret missions serve as conversation-starters for players to reflect on the role of surveillance technology in our lives. Puzzles in the game allude to the work of surveillance scholars like Simone Brown, Shoshana Zuboff, and Joy Buolamwini.</p>
                <p>To read more about these topics, see our post-game reading list. (Coming Soon!)</p>
                <h2>Can I preview the game?</h2>
