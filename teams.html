                <h2>What is a virtual escape room?</h2>
                <p>In traditional escape room games, players are locked in a room and solve puzzles to get out before time runs out</p>
                <p>In this virtual escape room, players explore a website looking for clues to help them make a challenging decision before time runs out. In addition to solving puzzles and completing the team objective, each player has an individual secret mission to accomplish.</p>
                <p>After the players finish the team objective or time runs out, there will be a big reveal and a post-game discussion for players to reflect on the team outcome and their missions.</p>
                <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
                <p>Panopticon explores the ethics of surveillance technology. Players are introduced to a fictional, yet realistic, high-tech security system used to deter and catch shoplifters. The central mystery of the game and the individual secret missions serve as conversation-starters for players to reflect on the role of surveillance technology in our lives. Puzzles in the game allude to the work of surveillance scholars like Simone Brown, Shoshana Zuboff, and Joy Buolamwini.</p>
